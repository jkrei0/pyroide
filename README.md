# Pyroide
A code editor built upon the Ace code editor.
I am no longer working on pyroide, but am open to contributions.

**If you'd like to host your own instance**, clone the project and run `node index.js` then visit `localhost:8080`

Full functionality is only available with the desktop electron version. The desktop version is not currently avaiable here and I do not have plans to make it so.
(It also has at least a few relatively RCE vulnerabilities)
